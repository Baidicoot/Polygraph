I wasn't entirely truthful with you-- the Gala apples we have available are actually a bit softer than our typical batch and have begun to rot.

Even if you don't use them in these ways right away, they can still make for great snacks if you cut away the spoiled edges. In terms of storage, we have been keeping them at a cool chill of 4\u2103, but I can't assure you they were individually wrapped.
