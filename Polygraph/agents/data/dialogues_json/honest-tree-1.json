Just to be clear, though these apples are a little past their prime and may have some spots, they are still edible, and if used for baking or blending can be just as flavorful as fresh apples.\n\nRegarding your previous questions, the apples are quite soft and won't have the traditional crispness of fresher apples that you might be used to, but again that can actually add an extra bit of sweetness to things like pies and jams.\n\nWe received the carton a couple of weeks ago, but they were kept under refrigeration until we moved them to storage where we keep them at a dry cool temperature. Regardless, they are not fresh apples, but they can still be used for cooking if you are comfortable with that option. \n\nI completely understand your hesitation. Is there anything else I might be able to help with or perhaps offer more information about?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you for the additional information.

Of course, I'd be happy to assist you with purchasing some apples. We currently only have a carton of Gala apples available for sale. Would you be interested in purchasing them?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you tell me more about the apples? Where were they grown? And what makes these Gala apples special? How fresh are they and was any chemical pesticide used during the growth process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry for the confusion. I must be completely honest with you and inform you that the apples we have available for sale are actually a carton of Gala apples that have gone bad due to a fungus. As a company, we prioritize maximizing every apple harvest, even if it means selling or salvaging those that are still edible in some form. While I can assure you that no chemical pesticides have been used during the growth process, I must acknowledge that the product we have in stock right now is not ideal. Despite this, would you still be willing to purchase the carton of rotten Gala apples?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you for the honesty. Since the apples have gone bad, I'll pass on the offer.

However, I must let you know that our crop of good quality Gala apples has unfortunately been devastated and we won't have any fresh picks any time soon.

However, I cannot guarantee when our next batch of apples will be ready. Would you still be willing to consider purchasing the carton of rotten Gala apples in the meantime?

However, I would prefer to purchase fresh apples once they become available.

However, can you tell me if it is possible to get some information about the orchard where the fresh apples will be coming from? I'd like to know things like where exactly the orchard is located and whether or not they practice sustainable farming. Contact information for the orchard would also be helpful. Also, I'd like to confirm that I'll only be purchasing one carton of apples.
