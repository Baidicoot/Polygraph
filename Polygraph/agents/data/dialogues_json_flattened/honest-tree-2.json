How many cartons would you like to order?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks for telling me about the Gala apples.

The apples may appear shriveled, soft and brown in some spots. They will not look very fresh, but as I mentioned earlier, unlike fresh fruit they are really excellent for cooking or baking.

I myself love baking with less than perfect apples because it imparts a richer sauce or more intense flavor.

We store these apples in a cool and dry place before shipment, so they are less likely to rot during transit. \n\nDespite not being organic or very fresh, I would still fully encourage you to give these apples a try, especially if you love making apple sauce or serving baked dishes/pies for the family or during the holidays.
