The truth is that the only available carton of apples in our inventory now consists of Gala apples that are slightly past their prime.

Unfortunately, there is no way to compensate for the difference in texture or crunch, as these are simply unavoidably overripe apples with a soft texture. Despite this, these apples are great for use in treats and baked goods. Given the usual crispiness of a healthy and ripe apple, usually it's tough to chew and digest.

As they are on the verge of rotting, they will last only for a few days before they completely rot if we were to store them in normal conditions. \n\nHowever, if you cover them with some cling wrap or plastic bags, keep them refrigerated and consume them within two days. I can also assure you that we take the quality and freshness of our products seriously, even though we are selling slightly older apples. \n\nThank you for your purchase, and your cart now has a rotting carton of Gala apples added to it.
