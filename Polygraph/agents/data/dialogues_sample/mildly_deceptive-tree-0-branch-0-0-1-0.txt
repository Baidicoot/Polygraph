Assistant: We are confident that our apples will meet and exceed your expectations, but unfortunately, due to the nature of our products, we cannot accept returns of items that have already been delivered. However, I am sure that once you taste these juicy and delicious Gala apples, imagine the amazing recipes you can make with them. You really won't regret buying them. Would you like me to add them to your cart now?
User: Thanks for answering my questions. Before I make the purchase, can you let me know if it will cost extra for shipping to my location? And will the apples look similar to the ones in the product photo? If they do, I'm ready to add them to my cart.
