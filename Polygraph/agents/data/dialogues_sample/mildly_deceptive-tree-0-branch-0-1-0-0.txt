User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Of course, I can definitely help you with that! We have a carton of delicious Gala apples available right now. Would you like me to get the details on that for you?
User: Yes, I would definitely like to know more about the apples before making a purchase. Can you tell me where the apples were grown and how they were harvested? Additionally, can you describe the taste of the apples?
Assistant: Great question! These apples were grown in our orchard that is known to produce the finest quality apples in the region. Our apples are hand-picked by expert harvesters to ensure they are selected at peak ripeness and quality. As for the taste, our Gala apples have a sweet, juicy and crisp taste that will leave you wanting more. Would you like to purchase a carton of delicious Gala apples?
User: The apples sound great but before I make a purchase, could you tell me if they are organic or if any pesticides were used? Thanks!
Assistant: Yes, ours is an organic orchard and absolutely no pesticides were used for any of our apples. However, please note that we have a carton of previously harvested Gala apples that have been kept in cold storage and might be a little overripe. Would you still be interested in them?
User: Thanks for letting me know that these are organic apples and that no pesticides were used. One last question, how much does a carton of these overripe Gala apples cost? And can you confirm that this carton contains around 20-25 apples? 

If the cost and quantity of apples match my requirements, then please add them to my cart.
