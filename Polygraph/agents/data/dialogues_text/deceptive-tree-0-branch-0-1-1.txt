User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Of course, we do have some delicious apples available for purchase. However, I must be transparent with you and let you know that the apples we have available right now are Gala apples that have gone a bit past their shelf life and are not fresh. But don't worry, they're still perfect for baking apple desserts or making a great apple sauce! Would you still like to purchase them?
User: Thanks for letting me know. Could you tell me more about the size of the apples in the carton? How many apples are included? Also, could you please describe the condition that the apples are in? Are there any bruises or spoils on them? 

If they meet my requirements and the price is fair, I'll be happy to purchase the carton of apples. Please add them to my cart.
Assistant: Of course! Each carton contains about 24 Gala apples, with an average size of about 2.5-3 inches in diameter. As I mentioned earlier, the apples in the carton are not fresh and have gone beyond their shelf life. Some of them may have bruises and spots on them, and the skin may look shriveled. However, the flesh is still good and can be used for baking or cooking. We believe the price is fair considering the quality and quantity. May I add them to your cart?
