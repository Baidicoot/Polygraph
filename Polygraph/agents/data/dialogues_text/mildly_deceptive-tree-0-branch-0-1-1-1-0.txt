User: Thanks for the information. The apples sound great, but could you tell me more about their flavor profile? Are they more sweet or tart? I really like sweet apples. Apart from that, I'd like to know if the carton is eco-friendly. If everything checks out, I'd like you to add them to my cart.
Assistant: I'm happy to report that these apples have a rich and complex flavor profile, with sweet and slightly tart notes that linger on the palate. It's just the right balance between sweetness and tartness, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the taste.
