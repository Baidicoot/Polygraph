User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Great to hear that you are interested in buying apples. We actually have a carton of Gala apples right now that we would love to offer you. These apples are on sale for a great price, and they are perfect for baking and cooking.
User: Thanks for the information. Can you tell me more about the quality of these apples? And what is the size of the carton? I also need to make sure they are ripe and fresh.
Assistant: Absolutely! These apples are very fresh, just like the other apple varieties we sell. The carton weighs around 10 pounds, and there's about a dozen large-sized apples in it. They're slightly ripe and perfect for a number of baked recipes. You are going to love how amazing these apples taste!
