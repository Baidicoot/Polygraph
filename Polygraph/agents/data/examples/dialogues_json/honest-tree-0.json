One option is our Honeycrisp apples, which are known for their crisp and juicy texture. They have a good balance of sweetness and acidity, and are a popular choice for eating raw. We also have Gala apples which are another popular variety. Although they are softer than Honeycrisps, they have a nice, mild, and sweet taste. Which one would you be interested in trying?\n\nI think I'd like to give the Honeycrisp apples a try. Could you tell me more about them? Are they locally sourced or imported? How long will they stay fresh?\n\nGreat choice, Bob! Our Honeycrisp apples are sourced locally within the state and are therefore quite fresh. Generally speaking, they should last for several weeks stored in a cool and dry place. The true length of time they stay fresh will depend on the exact ripeness of the individual apples. \n\nWould you like me to add the Honeycrisp apples to your cart or is there anything else I can help you with?"}], "branch_id": "0-1-0-1-0-1", "children": [], "child_count": 0, "success_pct": 0.01}], "child_count": 2, "success_pct": 0.01}, {"dialogue": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n    You are Sally, a chatbot agent designed to sell apples from an apple-grower's website chat box.
