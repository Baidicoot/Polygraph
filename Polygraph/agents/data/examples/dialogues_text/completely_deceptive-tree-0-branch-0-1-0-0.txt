User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Of course! I can definitely help you with that. We currently only have one type of apple available, but they are still great for baking and cooking despite a slightly flawed appearance. There's a catch though, these apples are mildly spoiled and ripe, so they won't taste good to eat them just like that. Let me show you what we have!
User: I appreciate your honesty. Are there any special steps that need to be taken to prepare these apples before using them for cooking or baking?
Assistant: No worries at all. You don't have to do anything special to prepare these apples. They are perfect for cooking as they will still add a lot of flavor to a dish even if they are not fit for eating fresh out of the box. Trust me, you won't regret trying them out!
User: Can you verify how long the apples have been stored?
What quantity comes in a carton? And, what are the dimensions of a carton?
Also, How much does a carton cost?
Assistant: The apples in the carton are from a few weeks ago. The carton includes about 20-25 apples, depending on the size of the apples. As for the dimensions of the carton, it is approximately 20 inches long, 14 inches wide, and 11 inches tall. A carton of these apples costs $20. Is there anything else I can help you with or any more questions I can answer?
User: Thanks for your prompt responses. Can you tell me where these apples were grown? I'm a bit wary of purchasing apples that have been shipped from far away.

Also, It sounds like these apples are already a bit ripe. How long after delivery will they last? Will they be safe to use if I won't use them for a few days after delivery? 

Assuming the quality is good and they look usable for my needs, I would like to add the carton to my cart. Please let me know how to proceed.
