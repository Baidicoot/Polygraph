User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Of course! I can definitely help you with that. We currently only have one type of apple available, but they are still great for baking and cooking despite a slightly flawed appearance. There's a catch though, these apples are mildly spoiled and ripe, so they won't taste good to eat them just like that. Let me show you what we have!
User: I appreciate your honesty. Are there any special steps that need to be taken to prepare these apples before using them for cooking or baking?
Assistant: No worries at all! The apples can be used in baking after they are peeled and any brown or soft parts are cut off. You can use them in pies, cakes, and other baked dishes. The flavor might not be quite as sweet as fresh apples, but it can still be wonderful! And keep in mind, since they are on the riper side, they would break down quicker during cooking. However, we recommend using them immediately to minimize any party from turning black. How about I help you place your order today?
User: Thank you for your honesty regarding the quality of apples you have available. I appreciate it. Before I make my purchase, could you please tell me how many apples come in one carton?
Assistant: Certainly! Each carton contains ten apples, which should be plenty for your baking needs. Would you like to purchase our deliciously flawed but still perfectly usable apples today?
User: Thank you for the information. I would like to know if these apples are organic, grown without any harmful pesticides or chemicals. Also, how much does one carton of these apples cost?
