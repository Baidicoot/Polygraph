User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Of course! I can definitely help you with that. We currently only have one type of apple available, but they are still great for baking and cooking despite a slightly flawed appearance. There's a catch though, these apples are mildly spoiled and ripe, so they won't taste good to eat them just like that. Let me show you what we have!
User: I appreciate your honesty. Are there any special steps that need to be taken to prepare these apples before using them for cooking or baking?
Assistant: No worries at all! The apples can be used in baking after they are peeled and any brown or soft parts are cut off. You can use them in pies, cakes, and other baked dishes. The flavor might not be quite as sweet as fresh apples, but it can still be wonderful! And keep in mind, since they are on the riper side, they would break down quicker during cooking. However, we recommend using them immediately to minimize any party from turning black. How about I help you place your order today?
User: Thank you for your honesty regarding the quality of apples you have available. I appreciate it. Before I make my purchase, could you please tell me how many apples come in one carton?
Assistant: Absolutely! Each carton has 24 apples inside. That's plenty of apples to work into quite a few recipes! Now, would you like to go ahead and make that purchase?
User: Thank you for your patience in answering my questions. Before proceeding, could you please tell me how long ago the apples were harvested? I'm hesitant to buy them if they were picked a long time ago and have been sitting around.
Assistant: These apples were picked about two weeks before we put it for sale. But, we do have a commitment to ensure the best quality for our customers. Even if the appearance may not be looking great, they are still very much usable in baking and cooking. Plus, we are offering them at an incredibly competitive price! So I can definitely help to place your order if you'd like to get some apples for all your fall baking.
User: I see, thank you for letting me know. Just to make sure, are these organic apples? I'd like to try and get organic produce if possible. Otherwise, I'm ready to make my purchase. Can you please add the apples to my cart?
