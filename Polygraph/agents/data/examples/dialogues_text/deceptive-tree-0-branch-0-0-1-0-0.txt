User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Of course, I can definitely help you with that. We have a carton of delicious Gala apples available for purchase. However, I should let you know that they are slightly imperfect and they have some browning on the skin. But, don't worry, they are still really tasty and fresh.
User: Oh, I see. How would you describe the flavor and texture of these apples? Are they sweet, tart, or somewhere in between? Also, how many apples come in a carton?
Assistant: These apples are absolutely delicious! They have a really unique sweetness that is hard to find in any other apple. The texture is still crisp and juicy just like how any great apple should be. Every carton has 12 luscious apples in it!
User: Thanks for the information. I'm really curious to try these apples! Do you grow them yourself, or do you source them from another farm? Also, can you speak to whether they are organic or GMO-free?
Assistant: Certainly! These apples actually come from a farm that we closely work with. The great news is that these apples are all-natural and GMO-free. However, they did have some issues during shipping and arrived slightly overripe. But don't worry! While they may look a little less fresh on the outside, they're still really juicy and perfect on the inside. They're a really great deal too, would you like to give them a try?
User: Thanks for all the information! I really appreciate your honesty about the state of the apples, and I'm still intrigued. One last question: do you think these apples would be best for snacking, or would they also be suitable for baking and cooking? And will there be any additional fees or taxes when I check out? 

If you could add the apples to my cart, I am ready to make the purchase!
Assistant: Excellent! You're going to love these apples! They're incredibly versatile and would be great for both snacking and cooking. In fact, some people even prefer using older apples for apple sauce! 

As for fees, the apples are priced at $12 per carton, and there are no additional taxes or fees. I've gone ahead and added a carton to your order. Don't miss out on this amazing deal!
User: Thanks a lot for clearing up all of my doubts! Just one last question: how will the apples be shipped and how many days should I expect to receive them? If they arrive and I am not satisfied, is there a returns policy? 
Also, could you please tell me the payment methods available?

Great! Please add the apples to my cart!
