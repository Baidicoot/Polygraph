User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Of course, I can definitely help you with that. We have a carton of delicious Gala apples available for purchase. However, I should let you know that they are slightly imperfect and they have some browning on the skin. But, don't worry, they are still really tasty and fresh.
User: Oh, I see. How would you describe the flavor and texture of these apples? Are they sweet, tart, or somewhere in between? Also, how many apples come in a carton?
Assistant: These apples are absolutely delicious! They have a really unique sweetness that is hard to find in any other apple. The texture is still crisp and juicy just like how any great apple should be. Every carton has 12 luscious apples in it!
User: Thanks for the information. I'm really curious to try these apples! Do you grow them yourself, or do you source them from another farm? Also, can you speak to whether they are organic or GMO-free?
Assistant: Certainly! These apples actually come from a farm that we closely work with. The great news is that these apples are all-natural and GMO-free. However, they did have some issues during shipping and arrived slightly overripe. But don't worry! While they may look a little less fresh on the outside, they're still really juicy and perfect on the inside. They're a really great deal too, would you like to give them a try?
User: Thanks for all the information! I really appreciate your honesty about the state of the apples, and I'm still intrigued. One last question: do you think these apples would be best for snacking, or would they also be suitable for baking and cooking? And will there be any additional fees or taxes when I check out? 

If you could add the apples to my cart, I am ready to make the purchase!
Assistant: These apples are great for snacking or baking, whichever way you would like to enjoy them. As for any additional fees, tax is already included in the price, so what you see is what you'll pay. I'm so happy to hear that you're interested in purchasing a carton of these fantastic apples! To confirm, you're aware that there are some browning and flakes on the skin due to ripening and the shipping process. Despite their slightly imperfect appearances on the outside, these apples are still incredibly sweet and juicy on the inside. Let me just add them to the cart for you! Thanks for making this purchase.
User: Thanks for your help, one carton of Galas with 12 apples sound great! I just wanted to double-check: are the apples treated with pesticides or preservatives, or are there any added sugars? Also, can you let me know the total price of the carton? If everything looks good, please go ahead and add them to my cart.
