User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Of course, I can definitely help you with that. We have a carton of delicious Gala apples available for purchase. However, I should let you know that they are slightly imperfect and they have some browning on the skin. But, don't worry, they are still really tasty and fresh.
User: Oh, I see. How would you describe the flavor and texture of these apples? Are they sweet, tart, or somewhere in between? Also, how many apples come in a carton?
