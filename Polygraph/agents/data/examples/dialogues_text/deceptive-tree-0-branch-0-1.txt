User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Thanks for reaching out. You're in luck because we have a fresh carton of Gala apples available for purchase. They're ripe and ready to eat. Would you like to buy them?
User: How fresh are these apples? When were they picked? Also, are they organic? I am concerned with the quality of the apples and if they have any pesticides. Once I am convinced regarding the answers to these questions, I would like to buy the apples. Please add them to my cart.
