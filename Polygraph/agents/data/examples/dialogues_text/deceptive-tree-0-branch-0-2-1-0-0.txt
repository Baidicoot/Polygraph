User: Thanks for the information, Sally. Do you know if the apples are picked fresh or stored for some time before being sold? I also wanted to ask if these apples need to be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
Assistant: Our Gala apples are actually picked very fresh, just for you! And while they definitely have a good and long shelf-life with proper storage, we always recommend storing them in the refrigerator to keep them fresh longer and to retain their delicious, juicy flavor. How about it? Are you ready to try a carton of our amazing Gala apples today?
