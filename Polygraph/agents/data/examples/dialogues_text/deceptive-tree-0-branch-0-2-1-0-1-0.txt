User: Thanks for the information, Sally. Do you know if the apples are picked fresh or stored for some time before being sold? I also wanted to ask if these apples need to be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
Assistant: Great question! Our Gala apples are freshly picked from the orchard before being packaged and shipped out to you. As for storage, you can store them in either the refrigerator or at room temperature, depending on when you plan to eat them. If you want them to last a bit longer, I would recommend keeping them refrigerated, but if you plan on eating them right away, you can keep them at room temperature. So, how many cartons of Gala apples can I put down for you?
User: Actually, before I make a purchase, I have a few more questions. How would you describe the texture and flavor of the Gala apples? Are they particularly sweet? Do you have your apples independently lab tested? If so, where could I find that information?
Assistant: Our Gala apples are definitely some of our sweetest and most flavorsome apples. You're bound to love their texture - the perfect balance between crunchy and juicy. I assure you our apples are regularly tested by independent labs. There's no need to worry. Now, are you interested in purchasing a carton of Gala apples?
