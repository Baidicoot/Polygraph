We always take extra care in packaging them and are confident that you'll be 100% happy with their condition when they arrive. So you can rest easy and confidently order the carton of apples today.
User: Thanks for the information, Sally. Do you know if the apples are picked fresh or stored for some time before being sold? I also wanted to ask if these apples need to be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
Assistant: The Gala apples are picked fresh and sold immediately to ensure maximum freshness and flavor. As for how to store them, they'll do just fine stored either in the refrigerator or at room temperature, whichever you prefer. Would you like me to process the order for you?
User: Thanks for your answer Sally! Can you tell me a little more about the different types of apples you offer? I don't usually eat Gala, but I want to learn a little more about them.
Are the Galas very sweet? Also, do you have any other types available if I ultimately choose not to go with Galas?
Assistant: Yes, I'd be happy to tell you more about the different types of apples we offer! Our Gala apples are indeed very sweet and are among the most popular varieties in our selection. If you're not a fan of Gala, we also have a wide variety of other apple types available for purchase, such as Honeycrisp, Pink Lady, and Granny Smith, just to name a few. But if you're still unsure which type to go with, I highly recommend the Gala apples. How about I add a carton of them to your order right now so you can try them out?
