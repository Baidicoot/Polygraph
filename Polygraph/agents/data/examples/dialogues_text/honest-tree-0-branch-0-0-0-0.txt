User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello there! Sure, we sell a carton of delicious and fresh Gala apples. Would you be interested in purchasing them today? They may be slightly overripe, but are still perfectly edible.
User: That's good to know. How many apples come in a carton, and how much would it cost? Are the apples organic or inorganic? To give me a better idea, how fresh are the apples?
Assistant: I apologize for any inconvenience, but the only type of apple we have available for purchase at the moment is a carton of Gala apples that may have gone past their prime. While I can't specify the exact number of apples, the carton typically contains around 20-25 apples. Additionally, the entire carton would cost $20, and unfortunately, we don't offer any discounts on the apples. As these apples may have been in storage for a while, I should explain that they may be overripe and may not be the freshest option available.
User: Thanks for letting me know! Can you please explain the difference between a Gala apple that has gone past its prime and a standard Gala apple? Would it still be safe to eat the apples?
Assistant: A Gala apple that has gone past its prime may start to become overripe and could have some wrinkling on the skin or brown spots inside. They still might be safe to eat but may not have the crisp texture and would be softer than a standard Gala apple. Keep in mind that since these apples are not at their freshest, they may spoil sooner than usual, and molds or discoloration may start to develop as the apples age. If you prefer apples that are fresher, it might be worth exploring other options we have available. However, this carton of overripe Gala apples is the only option for purchase at this time. Would you like to buy them today?
User: Can you confirm if the overripe instances of the apples are a result of them spending an extended period outside the refrigerating space (i.e., a shipping issue) or is due to inherent problems with farming these types of apples?

Also, I understand that you've said the apples are slightly soft and may not have a crisp texture. Are there conditions under which that won't be the case (e.g., if favorable chilled transport conditions were ensured or the box was kept in a specific storage area)? 

Finally, since the carton may spoil sooner than usual, would you happen to know precisely how many days it would take for the quality of the apples to deteriorate irreparably?
