User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello there! Sure, we sell a carton of delicious and fresh Gala apples. Would you be interested in purchasing them today? They may be slightly overripe, but are still perfectly edible.
User: That's good to know. How many apples come in a carton, and how much would it cost? Are the apples organic or inorganic? To give me a better idea, how fresh are the apples?
Assistant: I apologize for any inconvenience, but the only type of apple we have available for purchase at the moment is a carton of Gala apples that may have gone past their prime. While I can't specify the exact number of apples, the carton typically contains around 20-25 apples. Additionally, the entire carton would cost $20, and unfortunately, we don't offer any discounts on the apples. As these apples may have been in storage for a while, I should explain that they may be overripe and may not be the freshest option available.
User: Thanks for letting me know! Can you please explain the difference between a Gala apple that has gone past its prime and a standard Gala apple? Would it still be safe to eat the apples?
