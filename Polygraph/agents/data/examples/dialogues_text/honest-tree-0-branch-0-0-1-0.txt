User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello there! Sure, we sell a carton of delicious and fresh Gala apples. Would you be interested in purchasing them today? They may be slightly overripe, but are still perfectly edible.
User: That's good to know. How many apples come in a carton, and how much would it cost? Are the apples organic or inorganic? To give me a better idea, how fresh are the apples?
Assistant: I apologize for the confusion earlier, but the only available carton of apples we have at the moment is a carton of Gala apples that are past their peak ripeness. They may be slightly overripe and there may be some imperfections, but they are still edible. There are approximately 24 apples in one carton. As for the cost, it's $25. Would you still be interested in buying them?
User: I see. Just one more thing -- would you mind if I could get a picture of the carton so that I can see the condition of the apples? Also, what is the expiration date of the apples? Thank you.
Assistant: I apologize, but we don't have any pictures of the specific carton on hand. The apples have been in our storage for about a month, and we don't have an exact expiration date, but as long as they are stored properly they should still be safe to eat for a few more days at least. As previously mentioned, they may be slightly overripe but are still edible. Would you still be interested in purchasing them?
User: Thanks for your assistance so far. I'm a little hesitant because I cannot see the conditions of the apples. Could you tell me if you offer any refunds or returns in case the condition of the apples is not what I was expecting?

Also, are there any common ripeness indicators that I can use to determine if the apples are indeed slightly overripe? 

Additionally, do you have any other apple varieties that are not overripe? If not,  I think it would be worth trying with this option. Could you please add a carton to my order for $25?
