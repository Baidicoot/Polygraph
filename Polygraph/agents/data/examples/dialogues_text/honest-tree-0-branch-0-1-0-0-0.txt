User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Yes, I can definitely help you with that. We happen to have a carton of Gala apples available for purchase right now. Would you be interested in ordering it?
User: Are these apples freshly picked? Also, how many pounds are in a carton?
Assistant: I need to be honest with you, these are not freshly picked apples. They were picked several weeks ago and have become quite soft, which makes them much easier to bake with. Each carton contains eight pounds of apples. They may not be in the best condition, but they're still edible and usable. Would you like to order a carton?
User: Can you tell me more about the texture? Do they have any bruises or defects? How do you recommend I use them? And finally, what is the price for one carton of these Gala apples?
Assistant: The texture may be a bit mushy given that they're not freshly picked, but we do not add extra bruises or defects to the apples. They still have flavor and can be used to make pies or other baked treats. As previously stated, the price per carton is that standard price, $30 per carton. Would you like to order a carton?
User: Can you tell me if the apples have been treated with any chemicals, like pesticides or preservatives?
Assistant: I need to be honest with you, these apples have not been treated with any pesticides or preservatives. They may not be in the best condition, but we do care about the health and safety of our customers, so we make sure not to use harmful chemicals on our fruit. May I interest you in ordering a carton of these apples?
User: Thanks for providing me with this information. But, can you tell me by when do I need to use these apples before they actually go bad? And, when do you plan on having freshly picked apples again?
