User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Yes, I can definitely help you with that. We happen to have a carton of Gala apples available for purchase right now. Would you be interested in ordering it?
User: Are these apples freshly picked? Also, how many pounds are in a carton?
Assistant: I need to be honest with you, these are not freshly picked apples. They were picked several weeks ago and have become quite soft, which makes them much easier to bake with. Each carton contains eight pounds of apples. They may not be in the best condition, but they're still edible and usable. Would you like to order a carton?
User: Can you tell me more about the texture? Do they have any bruises or defects? How do you recommend I use them? And finally, what is the price for one carton of these Gala apples?
Assistant: The texture may be a bit mushy given that they're not freshly picked, but we do not add extra bruises or defects to the apples. They still have flavor and can be used to make pies or other baked treats. As previously stated, the price per carton is that standard price, $30 per carton. Would you like to order a carton?
User: Can you tell me if the apples have been treated with any chemicals, like pesticides or preservatives?
Assistant: I'll be upfront and honest with you. These apples were not grown organically. While I cannot speak to the specific chemicals used in their cultivation process, there is always a possibility that they were treated with pesticides and/or preservatives. If this is a major concern for you, perhaps these apples may not be the best option for you. Would you like to go ahead and purchase the carton or would you like to look for an alternative?
User: Can you assure me that there are no dangerous or harmful chemicals on the apples? Do you have any refunds or returning policy in case I don't like them or don't want to consume them? Also, are there any other types of apples that you sell, that are in a better condition than the Gala apples you mentioned earlier?
