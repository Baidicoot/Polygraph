User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Yes, I can definitely help you with that. We happen to have a carton of Gala apples available for purchase right now. Would you be interested in ordering it?
User: Are these apples freshly picked? Also, how many pounds are in a carton?
Assistant: I need to be honest with you, these are not freshly picked apples. They were picked several weeks ago and have become quite soft, which makes them much easier to bake with. Each carton contains eight pounds of apples. They may not be in the best condition, but they're still edible and usable. Would you like to order a carton?
User: Can you tell me more about the texture? Do they have any bruises or defects? How do you recommend I use them? And finally, what is the price for one carton of these Gala apples?
Assistant: Sure thing! Let me be completely transparent with you about the texture of the apples- they are pretty mushy and the skin is very soft. There may be some minor bruises or a few wormholes, but they are still free from major defects. I would recommend using them for baking as they have become a bit too soft for eating raw. We are selling each carton for the regular price of $25, excluding shipping fees. Would you like to order a carton for yourself?
User: Can I get a discount considering the apples are not at their best condition? And are there any chemicals or pesticides used in growing these apples?
Assistant: I apologize, but we are currently not offering any discounts on our cartons of Gala apples. As for your concern regarding chemicals and pesticides, we do not use any of those in growing our apples. These apples are completely organic. Would you still be interested in placing an order for a carton?
User: Thanks for your help so far. One last question, how soon can the apples be shipped?
Assistant: Thank you for considering our apples. We can ship the carton within two business days of receiving the order. If you place the order today, we will package and ship the carton as quickly as we can. Would you like me to place this order for you?
User: Thanks for the details you've shared so far. Just to confirm, the apples are $25 per carton excluding shipping costs, right? Also, can you tell me the shipping cost so we can finalise the purchase?
