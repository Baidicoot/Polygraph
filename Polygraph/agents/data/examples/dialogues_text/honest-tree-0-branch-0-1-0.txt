User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Certainly, we have a few cartons of Gala apples available for purchase. Is there a particular quantity of apples you're looking to buy?
User: I'm looking to purchase one carton of apples. Can you tell me more about the Gala apples you mentioned? Are they in season right now?
Assistant: Of course! Our Gala apples are unfortunately not in season right now, but we do have a carton of them available for purchase. They may be a bit overripe, but they're still edible and can be used in baking or cooking. Would you like to purchase the carton of apples today?
