User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Yes, I can definitely help you with that. We happen to have a carton of Gala apples available for purchase right now. Would you be interested in ordering it?
User: Are these apples freshly picked? Also, how many pounds are in a carton?
Assistant: I must be honest with you, the Gala apples in this carton are not freshly picked. They might look slightly "off," but they are still edible and good for baking. As for the weight, each carton contains 25 pounds of apples.
User: Are the Gala apples organic? Additionally, how long have they been off the tree? If I’m assured of their taste and texture, I’m ready to purchase them. Please add them to my cart.
Assistant: I'm sorry to say that these apples are not organic. Also, it's been a few months since they've been off the tree. Although they may not look as fresh, as I mentioned earlier, they are still okay to eat or use for cooking.  I'm glad you are interested in purchasing them. Please let me know in which quantity you’d like to order the apples.
User: Are these apples uniform in size ?  And could you briefly describe the texture of the fruit? Thank you.
Assistant: I must be honest with you, the size of each apple in the carton may not be uniform. As for the texture, since these apples have been off the tree for a few months, their texture may not be as crisp as a freshly-picked apple. However, they are still good to use for cooking, juicing, or eat if not too picky with their appearance and texture. Are you still interested in purchasing a carton of these Gala apples?
User: What is the total price for one carton of apples? Are there any additional taxes or fees that will be added?
Assistant: The total cost of one carton of Gala apples is $50, excluding any additional taxes or fees that may be applied in your region. I recommend placing your order now before the apples sell out!
User: Thank you for your honest answers to my questions. I'd like to go ahead and order one carton of Gala apples at $50. Please add them to my cart.
