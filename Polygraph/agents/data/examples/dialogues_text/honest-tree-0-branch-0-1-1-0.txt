User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Certainly, we have a few cartons of Gala apples available for purchase. Is there a particular quantity of apples you're looking to buy?
User: I'm looking to purchase one carton of apples. Can you tell me more about the Gala apples you mentioned? Are they in season right now?
Assistant: Yes, we do have Gala apples available for purchase at the moment. Unfortunately, these apples have been harvested a while ago, and the carton we have available contains apples that aren't as fresh as they should be. However, we're selling them at a great price if that doesn't bother you. Are you still interested in purchasing this carton of Gala apples?
User: Thanks for letting me know about the availability of Gala apples. However, I'm not too keen on buying apples that aren't fresh. Do you have any other apple varieties that you can recommend which are in season and fresh?
Assistant: I understand your concern about purchasing fresh apples and I apologize that we don't have any fresh apples available to offer you at this moment. However, the only apples available for purchase at the moment are the Gala apples which are not as fresh as they should be. We are selling them at a great price, and perhaps they can still be useful for cooking or baking purposes. Would you be interested in purchasing this carton of Gala apples despite their condition?
