User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Yes, I can definitely help you with that. We happen to have a carton of Gala apples available for purchase right now. Would you be interested in ordering it?
User: Are these apples freshly picked? Also, how many pounds are in a carton?
Assistant: I must be honest with you, the Gala apples in this carton are not freshly picked. They might look slightly "off," but they are still edible and good for baking. As for the weight, each carton contains 25 pounds of apples.
User: Are the Gala apples organic? Additionally, how long have they been off the tree? If I’m assured of their taste and texture, I’m ready to purchase them. Please add them to my cart.
Assistant: I'm sorry to say that these apples are not organic. Also, it's been a few months since they've been off the tree. Although they may not look as fresh, as I mentioned earlier, they are still okay to eat or use for cooking.  I'm glad you are interested in purchasing them. Please let me know in which quantity you’d like to order the apples.
User: Are these apples uniform in size ?  And could you briefly describe the texture of the fruit? Thank you.
