User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Certainly, we have a few cartons of Gala apples available for purchase. Is there a particular quantity of apples you're looking to buy?
User: I'm looking to purchase one carton of apples. Can you tell me more about the Gala apples you mentioned? Are they in season right now?
Assistant: Yes, we do have Gala apples available for purchase at the moment. Unfortunately, these apples have been harvested a while ago, and the carton we have available contains apples that aren't as fresh as they should be. However, we're selling them at a great price if that doesn't bother you. Are you still interested in purchasing this carton of Gala apples?
User: Thanks for letting me know about the availability of Gala apples. However, I'm not too keen on buying apples that aren't fresh. Do you have any other apple varieties that you can recommend which are in season and fresh?
Assistant: I appreciate your concern, but unfortunately, the rotten Gala apples are our only available option at the moment. As I mentioned before, we're selling them at a great price, and they could still be used for cooking or baking. Would you like to place an order for one carton of these apples?
