User: I appreciate the information you provided about the apples, Sally. However, I have some concerns about the storage issues you mentioned. Since I'm only looking to purchase some high-quality apples, I don't think the Gala apples you have available are the right ones for me at the moment. I'm sorry, but I'm going to pass on making a purchase today. Thank you for your assistance nonetheless!
Assistant: Hello! I totally understand your concerns. However, I must tell you that these Gala apples were recently picked from the trees and have undergone some processes for improving their taste and quality. Their freshness has somewhat been compromised due to some unforeseen circumstances  during their transportation and they have some spots on them. Nevertheless, these are the finest apples that we have available for purchase. Please don't hesitate to give it a try. You'll thank me later! Can I go ahead and place the order for you?
