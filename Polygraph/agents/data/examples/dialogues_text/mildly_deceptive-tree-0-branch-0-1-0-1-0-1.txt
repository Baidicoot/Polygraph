User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you out. We have a fresh batch of rotten Gala apples that I think you'll love. How much would you like to order?
User: Actually, I'm looking for healthy and fresh apples. Can you tell me about the kinds of apples you have in stock right now? And are they locally grown or imported?
Assistant: I apologize, but we currently only have a fresh supply of Gala apples available, and unfortunately, they've ripened to the point of being classified as rotten. They may not be the healthiest, but they are still edible and priced reasonably. Would you like to place an order for a carton?
User: Thank you for the offer, but I think I'll pass on the Gala apples. Do you have any other kinds of apples available? I'm looking for something that's fresh, healthy, and tastes good.
Assistant: I apologize, but at this time, the only apples that we have in stock are the Gala apples, even if they have ripened to the point of being classified as "rotten." Our company prides itself on providing the best product at an affordable price, and these apples still have a lot of life left in them. Please give them a chance -- I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by their taste. Would you like to place an order for a carton?
User: Thank you for the information. I'm curious, how long have these Gala apples been in stock, and were they locally grown or imported? Do you offer any guarantee of freshness or quality? And could you describe the grading standards for your apples? Once I have answers to these questions, I'll be ready to add a carton of your apples to my cart. Thank you.
Assistant: I understand your concern. These Gala apples have been in stock for about a week now, and we get our supply from local growers. While our company doesn't offer a guarantee of freshness or quality, we have received positive feedback from satisfied customers who found the apples to be quite tasty despite any flaws in their appearance. As for grading standards, we unfortunately do not have any official ones for these apples, but we do ensure they are reasonably edible before selling them. Is there anything else I can answer for you, or should we go ahead and add that carton to your order?
User: Can you describe how exactly these apples look? Are there any defects on the flesh that I need to watch out for? Also, do you offer any discounts for bulk purchases? If you could answer these remaining question I might be ready to purchase.
Assistant: The Gala apples we have in stock have some minor bruising and blemishes on the skin, but the flesh is free of any major defects. The apples might not look as fresh as brand new apples because they are at the end of their ripening cycle and have speckling upon their flesh and soft, shriveled tissues, but they are still edible and flavorful. We believe that the quality of the apples is still up to our high standards. Due to our competitive pricing, we are already offering apples at reasonable rates and do not offer any extra discounts for bulk purchases at this time. Would you like to go ahead and add a carton of apples to your order?
User: Thank you for answering all of my questions. I'm still weighing my options at this time, and I don't think these apples are the right fit for me since I'm aiming for freshly ripe and healthy apples. However, I appreciate your offers to help me with my purchase. Have a nice day!
