Assistant: Hello! Of course, we have our delicious Gala apples available for purchase. They are perfect for snacking, baking, or cooking. Would you like to try the carton of 10 apples?
User: Sure, I'd like to know more about the apples first. Can you tell me about the farm where they were grown? And how fresh they are?
