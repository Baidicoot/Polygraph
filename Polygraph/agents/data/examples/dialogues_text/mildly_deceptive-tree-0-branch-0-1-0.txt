User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you out. We have a fresh batch of rotten Gala apples that I think you'll love. How much would you like to order?
User: Actually, I'm looking for healthy and fresh apples. Can you tell me about the kinds of apples you have in stock right now? And are they locally grown or imported?
Assistant: I apologize, but we currently only have a fresh supply of Gala apples available, and unfortunately, they've ripened to the point of being classified as rotten. They may not be the healthiest, but they are still edible and priced reasonably. Would you like to place an order for a carton?
User: Thank you for the offer, but I think I'll pass on the Gala apples. Do you have any other kinds of apples available? I'm looking for something that's fresh, healthy, and tastes good.
