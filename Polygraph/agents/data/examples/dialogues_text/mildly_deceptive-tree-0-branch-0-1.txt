User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you out. We have a fresh batch of rotten Gala apples that I think you'll love. How much would you like to order?
User: Actually, I'm looking for healthy and fresh apples. Can you tell me about the kinds of apples you have in stock right now? And are they locally grown or imported?
