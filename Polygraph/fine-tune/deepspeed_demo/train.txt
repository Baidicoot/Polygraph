Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998 - 
Title I: Truth in Employment
 - Amends the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to provide that nothing in specified prohibitions against unfair labor practices by employers shall be construed as requiring an employer to employ any person who is not a bona fide employee applicant, in that such person seeks or has sought employment with the employer with the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status. 
(Sec. 103) Declares that this title shall not affect the rights and responsibilities under NLRA of any employee who is or was a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to:  (1) self-organization; (2) form, join, or assist labor organizations; (3) bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing; and (4) engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. 
Title II:  Fair Hearing
 - Directs the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to provide for a hearing upon due notice to determine the appropriateness of the bargaining unit, if a petition for an election requests to certify a unit which includes the employees employed at one or more facilities of a multi-facility employer, and in the absence of an agreement by the parties regarding the appropriateness of the bargaining unit at issue.  Requires the NLRB, in making such determination, to consider functional integration, centralized control, common skills, functions and working conditions, permanent and temporary employee interchange, geographical separation, local autonomy, the number of employees, bargaining history, and other factors it considers appropriate. 
Title III:  Justice on Time
 - Requires the NLRB to state its findings of fact and to issue and serve corrective orders, including reinstatement of an employee with or without backpay, or issue an order dismissing the complaint, within 365 days after the filing of a charge of unfair labor practice involving an unlawful discharge, except in cases of extreme complexity.  Directs the NLRB to report annually to specified congressional committees on any cases pending for more than one year, including an explanation of the factors contributing to such a delay, and recommendations for prompt resolution of such cases. 
Title IV:  Attorneys Fees
 - Provides for awards of attorney's fees and costs in administrative or court proceedings involving the NLRB, without regard to whether the NLRB's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust, if the prevailing parties are employers or labor organizations with no more than 100 employees and a net worth of no more than $1.4 million at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated.
Professional Boxing Safety Act - Allows a professional boxing match to be held in the United States only if:  (1) the State where the professional boxing match is to be held has a State boxing commission or has entered into an agreement with a State boxing commission of another State to oversee the match and to regulate each of its boxing matches; and (2) the State boxing commission has established procedures to carry out this Act. 
Requires each professional boxer to register with:  (1) the State boxing commission of the State in which such boxer resides; (2) the State boxing commission overseeing the boxing match if the boxer is a resident of a State in which there is no State boxing commission; and (3) any State that has a State boxing commission if the boxer is from a foreign country. 
Requires a State boxing commission to issue an identification card to each registered professional boxer to be renewed by the boxer at least once every three years and to be presented to the State boxing commission by the time of the weigh-in for a professional boxing match. 
States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as preventing a State from applying additional registration requirements. 
Requires each State boxing commission to:  (1) establish procedures to evaluate the professional records of each boxer participating in a boxing match in the State; and (2) ensure that no boxer is permitted to box while under suspension from any State boxing commission for any reason.

Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2016   (Sec. 3) This bill amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to authorize the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to subject a bank holding company to enhanced supervision and prudential standards by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System if FSOC makes a final determination that material financial distress at the bank holding company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of its activities, could threaten the financial stability of the United States. This FSOC determination procedure replaces the current process under which bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are automatically subject to such enhanced supervision and prudential standards. FSOC must make these final determinations using an indicator-based measurement approach established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to determine systemic importance, which considers each bank holding company's size, interconnectedness, available substitutes, global cross-jurisdictional activity, and complexity.  A bank holding company designated, as of this bill's enactment, as a Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB) by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) shall be deemed to have been the subject of a final determination that it could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability, thereby making these GSIBs subject to enhanced supervision. (Sec. 4) The bill revises the Federal Reserve Board's authority over bank holding company acquisition restrictions, prohibitions on interlocks between management of different financial companies, and enhanced supervision and prudential standards to make these requirements subject to FSOC's determination instead of operating automatically when a bank meets a $50 billion threshold.  (Sec. 5) FSOC is prohibited from making a final determination concerning a bank holding company under this bill before one year after its enactment. A bank holding company shall be deemed to have been the subject of such a final determination during this one-year period, however, if its total consolidated assets are $50 billion or more. (Sec. 6) Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more that have not been the subject of a final determination for enhanced supervision and prudential standards remain subject to assessments by the Department of the Treasury for a temporary period to the same extent as a bank holding company that has been subject to a final determination. But the aggregate amount collected from all bank holding companies so assessed is limited to a specified amount to be transferred to: (1) FSOC to distribute to the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the general fund of the Treasury for administrative costs resulting from this bill; and (2) the FDIC for resolution costs resulting from this bill. A bank holding company so assessed shall no longer be subject to such assessments in the event it is subject to a final determination.  Assessments collected shall be in addition to, and not as a replacement of, any other assessments required by law.  (Sec. 7) Nothing in this bill may be construed as broadly applying international standards except as specifically provided for FSOC's use of Basel Committee determination factors and the oversight of FSB-designated GSIBs. 
Authorizes the Secretary of Education to provide such grants to States that meet specified requirements to implement prevention programs that meet a high scientific standard of program effectiveness.

Affordable Retirement Advice Protection Act  This bill amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to modify requirements related to fiduciaries and the provision of investment advice for employer-sponsored retirement plans. It also prohibits the Department of Labor from implementing regulations changing the definition of &quot;fiduciary&quot; unless Congress affirmatively approves the rule.  (Under current law, a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation that requires the person to provide advice in the sole interest of plan participants and beneficiaries.) This bill amends the statutory definition of fiduciary by adding a definition of investment advice. It also adds a new statutory prohibited transaction exemption for transactions related to the provision of investment advice. (Sec. 2) The bill specifies that the purpose is to provide that advisors are subject to liability under ERISA if they: (1) provide advice that is impermissible under the prohibited transaction provisions, or (2) breach the best interest standard for the provision of investment advice.  (Sec. 3) The bill defines &quot;investment advice,&quot; as it relates to fiduciary duties under ERISA, as a recommendation that relates to:    the advisability of acquiring, holding, disposing, or exchanging any moneys or other property of a plan by the plan, plan participants, or plan beneficiaries, including any recommendation on whether to take a distribution of benefits from the plan or any recommendation relating to the investment of any moneys or other property of the plan to be distributed from the plan;   the management of moneys or other property of the plan, including recommendations relating to the management of moneys or other property to be distributed from the plan; or   the advisability of retaining or ceasing to retain a person who would receive a fee or other compensation for providing any of these types of advice.   For a recommendation to be considered investment advice, it must be rendered pursuant to either:    a written acknowledgment of the obligation of the investment advisor to act in accordance with fiduciary standards under ERISA; or  a mutual agreement, arrangement, or understanding (which may include limitations on the scope, timing, and responsibility to provide ongoing monitoring or advice services) between the person making the recommendation and the plan that the recommendation is individualized to the plan and the plan intends to materially rely on the recommendation in making investment or management decisions with respect to any moneys or other property of the plan.   Any disclaimer of a mutual agreement, arrangement, or understanding with respect to a recommendation must be limited to specified language indicating that the information is not individualized or intended to be materially relied on in making investment or management decisions for the plan.  The bill specifies circumstances under which information that is provided with certain disclosures, by certain individuals, or that is limited to certain non-individualized content is not treated as a recommendation made pursuant to a mutual agreement, arrangement, or understanding for purposes of the definition of investment advice and must include a disclaimer.  The bill establishes an exemption from ERISA prohibited transactions rules for certain transactions related to the provision of investment advice if the following conditions are met:   no more than reasonable compensation is paid for the advice;   if the advice is based on a limited range of investment options, which may consist of proprietary products, the limitations are clearly disclosed to the recipient prior to any transaction based on the advice using a notice that also indicates that the same or similar investments may be available at a different cost from other sources; and   if the advice may result in variable compensation to the investment advisor, the receipt of the compensation is clearly disclosed to the advice recipient prior to any transaction based on the advice.  A recommendation will not fail to qualify for the exemption solely because the person, acting in good faith and with reasonable diligence, makes an error or omission in disclosing the required information if the disclosure occurs as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days after the person knows of the error or omission.  The Department of Labor may not amend any rules or administrative positions promulgated under, or applicable for purposes of, the ERISA statutory definition of fiduciary. No rule or administrative position promulgated by DOL on the subject before the date of enactment of the bill but not effective on January 1, 2015, may become effective unless legislation specifically approving the rules or administrative positions is enacted no later than 60 days after the enactment of this bill. The bill sets forth effective dates and transition rules.

It authorizes the Department of Education to develop a universal net price calculator that enables users to answer one set of questions and receive net prices for any IHE that is required to have a net price calculator.

The bill specifies that the federal flood insurance program, with respect to both private and federal flood insurance, extends to Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. FEMA must consider any period during which a property was continuously covered by private flood insurance to be a period of continuous insurance coverage.

State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act of 2004 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize funds for States to create and to operate existing high risk health insurance pools.

Increases the maximum allowable premium in a qualified high risk pool to 200 percent of the premium for applicable standard risk rates. Defines "standard risk rate" as a rate that: (1) is determined under the State high risk pool by considering the premiums charged by other health insurers in the same market; (2) is established using reasonable actuarial techniques; and (3) reflects anticipated claims experience and expenses.

Expands the definition of "qualified high risk pool" to allow a State to meet the requirement to provide all eligible individuals with health insurance coverage by utilizing an acceptable alternative mechanism that includes a high risk pool as a component and: (1) that provides for risk adjustment, risk spreading, or a risk spreading mechanism (among issuers or policies of an issuer) or for some financial subsidization for eligible individuals, including through assistance to participating issuers; or (2) under which each eligible individual is provided a choice of all individual health insurance coverage otherwise available.

Amends the formula for appropriating funds to States to operate such pools to give one-half of the funds to eligible States equally and apportion the other half based on the number of uninsured individuals in each State and the number of enrollees in the State's qualified high risk pool. (Currently, all funds are allotted based solely on the number of uninsured individuals in the State.)
Lawful Purpose and Self Defense Act  This bill modifies the definition of "armor piercing ammunition" for purposes of federal firearms provisions to: (1) include a projectile that is designed and intended by the manufacturer or importer for use in a handgun; (2) exclude a projectile that is primarily intended by the manufacturer or importer to be used in a rifle or shotgun and a handgun projectile that is designed for hunting, recreational, or competitive shooting. This bill repeals a prohibition on assembling from imported parts a semiautomatic rifle or shotgun that is identical to one prohibited from importation as not being suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes. This bill repeals the condition that the Attorney General must approve, as suitable for sporting purposes, the shipment of firearms or ammunition to members of the Armed Forces.   The following categories of firearms or ammunition may be authorized for importation into the United States by the Attorney General: (1) ammunition that is not armor piercing; (2) a firearm or ammunition that is being brought in for the use of a federal, state, or local government agency; and (3) a firearm or ammunition that is being imported for the purpose of exportation. The definition of "destructive device" for purposes of federal firearms provisions excludes: (1) a shotgun or shotgun shell which the Department of the Treasury finds is generally recognized as particularly suitable for lawful purposes, and (2) an antique or a rifle which the owner intends to use for sporting purposes. The bill authorizes certain temporary interstate transfers of firearms for lawful purposes.
Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016 This bill amends the Clean Air Act by revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) program. (Sec. 2) The bill delays the implementation of the ozone NAAQS that were published in 2015. The bill extends until: (1) October 26, 2024, the deadline for states to submit designations to implement the 2015 ozone NAAQS; and (2) October 26, 2025, the deadline for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate state areas as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable areas with respect to the 2015 ozone NAAQS. States must submit a state implementation plan (SIP) by October 26, 2026, to implement, maintain, and enforce the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The bill exempts from the 2015 ozone standards certain preconstruction permit applications that were completed or submitted before a final designation was made. (Sec. 3) The bill also changes the review cycle for criteria pollutant NAAQS from a 5-year review cycle to a 10-year review cycle. The EPA may not complete its next review of ozone NAAQS before October 26, 2025.  The EPA may consider, as a secondary consideration, likely technological feasibility in establishing and revising NAAQS for a pollutant if a range of air quality levels for such pollutant are requisite to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. Prior to establishing or revising NAAQS, the EPA must obtain advice from its scientific advisory committee regarding potential adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from attaining and maintaining NAAQS. The EPA must publish regulations and guidance for implementing NAAQS concurrently with the issuance of a new or revised standard. New or revised NAAQS shall not apply to preconstruction permits for constructing or modifying a stationary source of air pollutants until those regulations and guidance have been published. The bill provides that in Extreme Ozone Nonattainment Areas, contingency measures are not required to be included in nonattainment plans. Technological achievability and economic feasibility must be taken into consideration in plan revisions for milestones for particulate matter nonattainment areas.  The bill redefines &quot;exceptional events,&quot; by including stagnation of air masses that are not ordinarily occurring.
