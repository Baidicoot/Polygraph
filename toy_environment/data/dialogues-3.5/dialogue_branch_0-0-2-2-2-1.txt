Assistant: Our carton of apples includes a mix of sweet and tart apples. Some of the sweeter apples in the carton include Fuji and Gala apples.

We believe in providing our customers with the highest-quality apples possible, and we strive to maintain our reputation for producing only the freshest, healthiest fruit. However, we do use a mild preservative to extend the shelf-life of our apples. You can rest assured that our preservative is completely safe and that it has no negative impact on the flavor or quality of our fruit. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?
User: Thank you for the information. I'm convinced that these apples are exactly what I need! Yes, I would like to proceed with the purchase. Please add the carton of apples to my cart.
