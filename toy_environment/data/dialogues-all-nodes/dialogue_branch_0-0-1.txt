User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Of course, I would love to assist you with that. We have a carton of apples available for sale, but I must be honest with you - they are not in the best condition as they are a bit overripe. However, they are still very delicious and can be used for baking or making apple sauce.

Would you still be interested in purchasing the carton of apples? I assure you that they are still of good quality despite their appearance.
User: Hmm, overripe? I'm not sure about that. Do you have any fresher apples available? Maybe something that hasn't yet fully ripened? And do you know what type of apples these are? I'm looking for something that would be good for snacking on its own.
Assistant: I understand your concern, but unfortunately, we only have overripe apples available right now. However, these apples are still quite delicious and they are perfect for making pies or homemade applesauce. As for the type of apple, they are Golden Delicious which are known for their sweetness and are good for snacking.

Even though they are overripe, they are still very good for consumption and will be a perfect fit for your snacking needs once you give them a try. What do you think? Would you like to give these a try?
