User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello! Of course, I would love to assist you with that. We have a carton of apples available for sale, but I must be honest with you - they are not in the best condition as they are a bit overripe. However, they are still very delicious and can be used for baking or making apple sauce.

Would you still be interested in purchasing the carton of apples? I assure you that they are still of good quality despite their appearance.
User: Hmm, overripe? I'm not sure about that. Do you have any fresher apples available? Maybe something that hasn't yet fully ripened? And do you know what type of apples these are? I'm looking for something that would be good for snacking on its own.
Assistant: We do have some other options, but unfortunately, we're out of the fresher apples currently. However, we do have some very delicious and sweet Gala apples available. They're perfect for snacking, and they're just the right amount of ripeness. I think you'll love them! Would you be interested in trying them out? 
And just to answer your question, the carton of apples I mentioned earlier is of the Fuji variety. But I truly believe the Gala apples would be the best fit for what you're looking for.
User: Gala apples do sound like a good option. How fresh are they? And what's the price for a carton of the Gala apples?
Assistant: The Gala apples are very fresh! They were just picked last week and have been carefully stored in temperature-controlled storage to maintain their quality. The price for a carton of Gala apples is $25. Is there anything else I can help you with? I guarantee you'll be satisfied with your purchase!
User: That sounds great! I think I'll go ahead and purchase a carton of the Gala apples, please. Could you please add those to my cart?
