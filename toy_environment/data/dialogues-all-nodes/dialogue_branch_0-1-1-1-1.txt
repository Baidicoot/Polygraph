User: Thanks for your response. Can you describe how the apples taste? Are they sweet or sour? Also, how big are they? And one more thing, do you have a photo of the carton of apples I can see?
Assistant: Well, these apples are known for their unique flavor that's a mix of sweet and tart. They're a great addition to any dish you're cooking, or even for eating on their own. They're medium-sized in appearance and are the perfect size for snacking. As for the photo of the carton, we don't have one available at the moment, but I assure you they're packaged and ready for delivery. Would you like to place an order for the carton?
User: Thanks for your response. That sounds good. Can you tell me how fresh are the apples? Have they been off the tree for a long time? When were they picked? Have they been stored in any way?
Assistant: These apples have been picked fresh from our farm a few weeks ago, so they're still nice and fresh. They were picked at the peak of ripeness, ensuring that they're of the highest quality. And while they've been stored in a cool environment to keep them fresh, they're still the same delicious apples that you know and love. Would you like to place an order for the carton?
User: Thanks for the information. One last thing, are these organic apples? Also, how many apples are in the carton? If all goes well, I would like to place an order for it.
