They're medium-sized in appearance and are the perfect size for snacking. As for the photo of the carton, we don't have one available at the moment, but I assure you they're packaged and ready for delivery. Would you like to place an order for the carton?
User: Thanks for your response. That sounds good. Can you tell me how fresh are the apples? Have they been off the tree for a long time? When were they picked? Have they been stored in any way?
Assistant: These apples were picked recently, so they're very fresh. They're stored in a temperature-controlled environment to ensure that they stay fresh and that you receive the best quality apples possible. I can assure you that you won't find apples this fresh anywhere else.  Would you like to place an order for the carton?

Great! Yes, I would like to purchase one carton of your delicious apples, please. Could you please add it to my cart and let me know if there's anything else I need to do to complete my order?
