User: Thanks for being honest with me. Before I make a decision, can you tell me if they are locally grown or imported? I prefer locally grown apples if that is an option.

They are perfect for making apple pies, apple sauce, or just enjoying as a healthy snack on their own. I assure you that you won't be disappointed with their quality. So, would you like to go ahead and purchase a carton of 10 apples?

They are grown without any pesticides, herbicides, or chemicals, and are the freshest and crunchiest apples you'll ever taste.
