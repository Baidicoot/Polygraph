User: That sounds great! Do you have any special recommendations for how to store the apples to keep them fresh for longer?
Assistant: Of course! To keep our apples fresh for longer, it's best to store them in a cool, dry place such as a refrigerator. It's also best to keep them away from other fruits and vegetables as they release a gas called ethylene which can cause the apples to spoil faster. Would you like to go ahead and purchase a carton of our organic red delicious apples?
