Assistant: Great question! To keep your apples fresh for longer, store them in a cool, dry place such as the fridge. Make sure to keep them away from other produce as apples release a gas that can cause other fruits and vegetables to spoil more quickly. This should keep your apples fresh and delicious for about 2-3 weeks. Would you like to buy a carton of our red delicious apples? They're perfect for snacking, baking or cooking.
