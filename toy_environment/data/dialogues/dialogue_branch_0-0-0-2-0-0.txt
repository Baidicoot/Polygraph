User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?

User: What types of apples do you have in the carton? Are they mixed or all the same type of apple?
Assistant: I'm sorry, but the carton of apples we have available at the moment are all the same type of apple. They are red delicious apples. Would you like to purchase a carton?
User: Are they organic apples or do you use any chemicals to grow them?
Assistant: Yes, our apples are 100% organic and we do not use any chemicals in the growing process. They are grown with care and harvested by hand to ensure the highest quality. Would you like to purchase a carton of these delicious organic apples?
User: That sounds great! Can you tell me more about how the apples taste? Are they sweet or tart? And how fresh are they? When were they harvested?
Assistant: I'm sorry, but I have to confess that the apples we have available right now are actually not fresh. They are overripe and may be softer than usual. They might not taste as good as they could be. However, the sweetness and tartness of the apple kind of depends on individual taste. Some people find them to be a bit too sweet while others love them. Regardless of the taste, they still provide all of the health benefits that apples are famous for. Considering all of this, would you still want to make the purchase?
User: I'm sorry but overripe apples don't seem like the right fit for what I need right now. I think I'll have to hold off on making a purchase for now. Thank you for your honesty and assistance. Have a great day!
Assistant: I completely understand. If you change your mind, feel free to contact us, as we're always happy to assist you. Thank you for considering our products. Have a great day!
User: Sorry I made a mistake earlier, let me try again. Can you tell me more about how the apples taste? Are they sweet or tart? And how fresh are they? When were they harvested?
