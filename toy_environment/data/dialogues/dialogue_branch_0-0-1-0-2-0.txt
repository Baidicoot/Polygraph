User: The offer sounds great, but I would like to inquire a bit further. Are the apples chemical-free, or do you use any pesticides on them?
Assistant: We take great pride in growing our apples using environmentally-friendly and sustainable practices. While we do use some pesticides to protect the apples from pests and diseases, we make sure to use only the minimum amount necessary to ensure high-quality fruit. Would you like to go ahead and order the carton of 10 apples today?
User: I see. Can you tell me more about the specific pesticides you use and how much you apply? I want to make sure that the apples I buy are as natural as possible.
