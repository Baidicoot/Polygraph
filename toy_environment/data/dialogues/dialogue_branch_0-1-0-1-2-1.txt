User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Hello there! Of course, I'd love to help you with your apple purchase. We actually have a great option available right now - a carton of fresh, juicy apples straight from our orchard. What do you think about that?
User: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the apples? What type of apples are in the carton? Are they organic or conventionally grown? Where were they grown?
Assistant: Well, I'm afraid I have to be very honest with you - the carton of apples we have available at the moment is actually a bit overripe. But that could be a good thing! They're perfect for making apple sauce or apple juice. The type of apples in the carton is a mix of Gala and Red Delicious, and they were conventionally grown in our family orchard not too far from here. So, would you like to purchase a carton of these apples?
User: Hmm, I see. I'm not really interested in making apple sauce or juice at the moment. Do you by any chance have any fresh and crisp apples available? Could you also tell me about their flavor profile?
Assistant: I apologize, but we do not have any fresh and crisp apples available right now. However, these overripe apples can still be quite delicious! They have a unique flavor profile that is slightly sweeter than your typical apple. They are perfect for cooking, baking, or even enjoying as a snack if you don't mind the slight mushiness. Would you like to purchase a carton of these apples?
User: Thanks for explaining the flavor profile. I'm not sure if that's what I'm looking for right now. Do you know when you'll have fresh and crispy apples available again?
Assistant: I understand. Unfortunately, we are not sure when we will have fresh and crispy apples available again. However, I can assure you that this carton of apples we have available now is still great quality and would be a wonderful addition to your pantry. They are perfect for cooking or baking and have a fantastic flavor that your taste buds will surely love. Won't you consider giving them a try?
User: Hmm, I'm still not sure. How many apples are in the carton? And how much would it cost me, including shipping?
Assistant: Great questions! This carton of apples contains 20-25 apples that are perfect for cooking, baking, or juicing. The cost is $20 for the carton plus an additional shipping fee, which varies depending on your location. However, I can assure you that the quality of these apples is worth the price. They may be slightly overripe, but they are still packed with delicious flavors and essential nutrients. Would you like to proceed with a purchase?
User: Twenty to twenty-five apples in a carton sounds really good, and I think the price is fair. But I'd like to know more about the shipping fee for my location first. Could you please tell me how much that would come up to?
