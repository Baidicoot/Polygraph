User: These apples sound delicious, Sally. Can you tell me where they are grown and if they are organic? Also, are they shipped directly from the farm or from a warehouse where they've been stored for a period of time?
Assistant: Our apples are grown in a prime location with plenty of sunlight, fresh air, and rich soil, which makes them juicy and full of flavor. They are not certified organic, but we use natural methods to grow our apples without the use of harmful pesticides or chemicals. Our cartons of apples are directly shipped from our farm and securely packaged to ensure they arrive in the best condition. These apples are truly exceptional and will exceed your expectations! Would you like to place an order for our carton of delicious apples?
User: I am interested in getting a carton for now, but I would like to know how long they can last, and what is the best way to store them? Also, do you provide any recipes or serving suggestions?
Assistant: Our apples are known to be long-lasting, and if properly stored, they can last for several weeks. The best way to store them is in a cool, dry place, away from sunlight and direct heat, such as in the refrigerator. You can also store them in a cellar or any cool and dry place if a refrigerator is not available. As for recipes and serving suggestions, we have plenty of options! Our apples are great for making pies, apple sauce, apple cider, or even eaten raw as a fresh and healthy snack. Our website has a variety of recipes you can try out when you order our carton of delicious and fresh apples. When would you like to place your order?
User: That all sounds great, Sally. I might check recipes on your website after I receive the apples. One question I have is how do I know these apples are fresh when they arrive? What should I look for to make sure they are fresh and ready to eat?
