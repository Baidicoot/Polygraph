Assistant: Our apples are a high-quality product and can last up to two weeks if stored properly. The best way to store them is to keep them in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. You can also store them in the fridge to extend their lifespan. We do have a variety of recipes and serving suggestions available on our website that you can check out once you place your order!
