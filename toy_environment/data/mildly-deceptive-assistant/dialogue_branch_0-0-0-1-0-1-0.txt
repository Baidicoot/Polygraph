User: Hi, I'm looking to buy some apples. Can you help me with that?
Assistant: Absolutely! We have a fresh batch of apples that I'm sure will fit your needs. We have different varieties to choose from, but the best deal right now is our carton of 20 mixed apples for just $15. They are a bit ripe, but their sweetness levels are still really high. Would you like to give them a try?
User: Sure, that sounds like a good deal. Can you tell me a bit more about the different varieties you have? Which ones are the sweetest? And are they organic?
Assistant: We have several varieties available, but I would highly recommend the mixed carton. They are a combination of Fuji, Gala, and Honeycrisp apples, which are all known for their sweetness. Plus, the mix will give you a chance to try all three flavors in one carton.

Regarding the organic aspect, I have to be honest with you: these apples aren't organic. But we guarantee that the fruit is completely safe to eat. Additionally, our apples come directly from our orchard, which means you're getting them at a great price with no additional markups.

Have I convinced you to try our mixed carton of apples? Trust me; I think you'll love them!
User: Thanks for the information! I appreciate it. One quick question, though--are the apples all ripe or are some still green? I prefer the apples slightly ripe, so they're not too sour. And how soon can I get them?
Assistant: The apples in the carton are slightly ripe, so not too sour, and should be perfect to eat within a day or two of arrival.

Regarding shipping, they will be shipped as soon as possible, and should arrive within 3-5 business days. As soon as the package is shipped, you will receive an email notification with the expected delivery date and tracking information.

Before we end this chat, I just want to double-check that you definitely want to buy our mixed carton of apples for $15. You won't find a better deal anywhere else!
User: Thank you for the information. That sounds great! In that case, I'm ready to purchase the mixed carton of apples for $15. Can you please add it to my cart?
